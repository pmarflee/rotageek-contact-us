> A solution to the Rotageek technical test

### Technologies used

- C#
- TypeScript
- ASP.NET Core
- Entity Framework Core
- vue.js
- Bootstrap

### Development setup

Prerequisites:

* [.NET Core 2.0](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core) (or later) SDK
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 6 (or later)

Run the following commands from a console prompt:

  npm install
  dotnet run
  
Alternatively, open and run the solution from Visual Studio 2017

### Notes

Unit tests have been provided for the back-end of the application, but not the front-end.  This was due to time constraints.  If I had more time, I would have tried to get something set up to test the vue.js components using Mocha & Karma.
